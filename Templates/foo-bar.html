        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p>This is a second template file, now everything is being split up into pieces. So now you can see how maybe you can
have a header, sidebar, body content, footer etc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p>As you can see by the date here in the second file (@=@today@=@) template variables are usable in all template files
            loaded in one instance</p>
            <p>And here is another variable that was added after the first template file was loaded but before this one was its the
            server path: @=@serverPath@=@</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <footer class="footer">
        <div class="container footer_contents">
            <p class="text-muted">Here is a footer</p>
        </div>
    </footer>
